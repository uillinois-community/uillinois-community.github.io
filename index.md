Community-supported documentation for the [University of Illinois GitHub
service][10], designed to fill the gap between AITS' service-level documentation
and 1-on-1 training by providing a searchable archive of community
questions and resources.

[10]: https://web.uillinois.edu/github

These resources may be other github orgs, repos, or gists; links to
documentation; or simply answers to questions.
